19:18:36.658	      error: Multiple top-level packages discovered in a flat-layout: ['public', 'backend', 'services', 'components', 'node_modules', 'extracted_zip', 'attached_assets'].

19:18:36.658	      
19:18:36.658	      If you are trying to create a single distribution with multiple packages
19:18:36.658	      on purpose, you should not rely on automatic discovery.
19:18:36.658	      Instead, consider the following options:
19:18:36.659	      
19:18:36.659	      1. set up custom discovery (`find` directive with `include` or `exclude`)
19:18:36.659	      2. use a `src-layout`
19:18:36.659	      3. explicitly set `py_modules` or `packages` with a list of names
19:18:36.659	      
19:18:36.659	      To find more information, look for "package discovery" on setuptools docs.
